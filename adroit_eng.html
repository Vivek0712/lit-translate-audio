                    <br/>
                    On a fine morning, I got a bus to reach my college, there I saw a girl with a blue bag on her back and a travel bag in her right hand. I recognized her, she is the girl behind who exactly I sit behind all-time in my tuition classes, sorry I revealed unwanted stuff, change that with “she is the girl usually sit in front of me all the time”. If I sat on the left corner she came left, if I go right corner she comes right. “Well!” I sat in middle “Oh my god!” she is sitting in front of me again, exactly opposite to me. I shocked initially, days passed I overcame her activity in days.<br/><br/> After figuring out her, I saw whether her dad was left. I placed my bag on my seat to mark that seat for me. I made my steps to her slowly. I reached my destination. I just want to spell some words, I had a confusion to choose the language. Finally, I chose English, to make myself modern. “H” started to spell HI, bus driver interrupted well by starting the bus, my voice became low. So I gave a pause and gave chance to the driver. He made his majestic sounds and the bus came to normal until I held the pole nearby. <br> There stayed a silence. I made this chance useful. “Hey”, I said with a great smile on my face. She looked shocked I don’t know either myself or my smile made such a feeling. She replied “Hey” and gave two blinks. I didn’t give up that smile is holding over my mouth. “How are you?” I asked just making my smile to stay down a while. She looked at me from top to bottom, instead of answering my easiest question she made a cross-question, “Who are you?” Now am unanswerable here. <br> Now I made the two blinks. I made my feet step back for two steps, the finest road services helped me to manage well. I made a description about me, even I hadn’t made even in my resume because it includes all my incidents with that girl. <br/><br/> She made some words with a spooky head, “yeah, that guy ah ok ok”. Then I don’t know what to say more. I saw the seat was empty behind her, I marked that place with my eye and the neighbor of that seat, an old man sleeping. “Perfect”, my mind said. I made my step faster and took the bag of my previously placed seat and hurried to the new seat I marked. What to do guys, history repeats again she is always sitting opposite to me always what can I do. <br/><br/> I just leaped to see what she is doing oops! The seat was height, I haven’t mentioned am short, only the seat was high. I just made my legs force to that seatback. A vibration was made, I doubted whether she was able to distinguish the vibrations from the bus. Yep, she did. She turned back I just looked on the other side and acted unnoticed. I know she saw me acting. She made a smile and turned back. <br/><br/> I tilted my head to my extreme corner to see her. She was dazzling, my heartbeat slowed down, with calmness, I wore a headset, on a speed breaker I lost them from ears, but my ears still hear a romantic melody. I smiled myself. She turned back, I noticed it and I made myself acting like sleeping, but I had a half eye. She just extended her hand with mobile to call me, only her hand came, as I didn’t show up she made her head to look back. She smiled at me and back to her position. <br/><br/> I thought myself stupid for wasting this wonderful opportunity. Thinking over my memories of buying dairy milk for her which I lost in the same tuition, now my lips want to speak with her at least a few words. I got up from my seat and spelled her name slowly. To my disappointment, she slept. <br/><br/> What to do next I thought, thinking I closed my eyes. Suddenly someone shook my hands its none other than her. She said that her stop will be there in 5 minutes, I smiled that she considered me a person. I was in an excited state then. My lips want to smile but I don’t wish to scare her this time. I just made my lips curve a little. <br/><br/> She asked a help. I was eager to help, she said, “I kept my mobile somewhere, I can’t find it please help me, I shouldn’t have woken you”. I was more heroic now, she needs my number, acting weird. Now am here to get her mobile number. I asked for her number. She spelled it. I typed it. I made a call, I heard a ring sound under my leg. <br/><br/> I took the mobile and handed it over to her. She thanked me and she got down. She was on her way and am on my way. I reached my home. I made myself comfortable, I picked my mobile, scroll down for her number. I found her number and made a call. The first ring went by, the second ring went by, the third, followed by 7 rings, then attended the call. Silence for a while. The call ended. I slapped myself with my mobile and talked myself that am the one to call so am the one to speak first. <br/><br/> I made a call again. Total disappointment lies here. That the person on the other side told that the mobile was missed and a girl saved it for them. Even though they scolded me I imaged her in mind. After a while is using my social media, as usual. A beep notification from what’s app “image”. I just downloaded it, that was a picture of me sleeping on the bus. I shocked at that moment my hands moved to my mouth. Eyes became two times larger. Followed by a message check your bag’s side zip. <br/><br/> I ran to the hallway where I kept the bag. I opened the side zip there was a folded paper, a torn paper, and a diary milk chocolate wrapper. There was a torn paper piece I just shocked to see it, there written was my name and my class that was a piece from my tuition notebook. <br/><br/> I took this stuff and ran to my room I opened the paper, the rest is my life what am living now.
